# Collection of Defold Editor Scripts and UI

Useful Editor Scripts with custom UI for Defold.

> Note!
Curent scripts run and are tested on Windows. OS-independent scripts (e.g. creating components) should work on all platforms. I might do Linux too in the future. MacOS PRs are welcomed.

# GUI ü™ü

## gui-add-script üìú

It creates a `.gui_script` file and links it to this `.gui` component immediately (to `Script` property).

1. Right click on any `.gui` file in `Assets`.
2. Select `Add GUI Script`.

## gui-add-to-collection ü™ü

It creates both `.gui` component and `.gui_script` files binded together **and** puts a game object with gui component with this gui directly in collection. It also has a UI popup, where you can type a name!

1. Right click on `root` in your collection's `Outline` pane.
2. Select `Add GUI to collection`.
3. Type in a name and click `Enter`.
4. Click `Create`.

# Sound üîä

> Note! Read FFmpeg dependency section below before first use.

##  sound-convert ‚ôªÔ∏è

It allows you to convert sound file(s) (`.mp3`, `.wav.`, `.ogg`, `.flac` or `.aac`.) to one of Defold compatible sound files (`.wav`, `.ogg`).

1. Right click on any sound file (or selected multiple sound files).
2. Select `Convert Sound`.
3. Select output file format from a dropdown list (`OGG` or `WAV`)
4. Click `Convert`

For each source file, it creates a file with the same name as a source file, in the same location, but with `.wav` / `.ogg` extension. File is at 44100 Hz.

## sound-play ‚ñ∂Ô∏è

It allows you to "prehear" given sound. Plays `.mp3`, `.wav`, `.ogg`, `.flac` or `.aac`. It plays the sound once either until end of file or until the moment when the popup UI is closed.

1. Right click on any sound file.
2. Select `Play`

P.S.
There are two versions of this script actually, but second is commented out:
1. **Play**
when you run it first time your OS might go crazy - it plays in background, but because of this, it requires your explicit permissions, e.g. Windows asks for permission to run from Unknown Publisher.
You can uncheck this bottom checkbox saying `"Always ask before opening this file"` and it should never prompt again.
Your antivirus might also block or quantine it - you can make an exception for it.
opens terminal window additionally. You can then either close this window or closing the UI popup in Defold will also close it.
2. **Play in Terminal**  
because of issues above, I leave there another version that is "safe" - plays in separate Terminal Window. If you like it more, you can use this (just comment out Play in Terminal command in the script).

I would love if someone could figure out and propose better solutions :D 

## sound-cut ‚úÇÔ∏è

It allows you to cut a subtrack out of the source track (`.mp3`, `.wav`, `.ogg`, `.flac` or `.aac`). It needs `start` and `end` timestamps and creates one subtrack saved into file of same format, where X is start (in seconds from original sound beginning) and Y is stop timestamp (in s). 
`end` has to be larger than `start`. 
`end` can't be larger than source sound duration (provided as information in popup)

1. Right click on any sound file.
2. Select `Cut Subtrack`.
3. Set `Start Time` and `End Time` timestamps (in seconds). Eventually change output Subtrack file name.
4. *Experimental.* You can eventually "prehear" the cut subtrack by clicking `Play Subtrack` button. Close the popup to stop it playing.
5. Click `Extract` to extract the cut subtrack to a file.

P.S. It checks for input validity and also asks if you want to overwrite if file with same name exists. Also, make sure you click "somewhere" after editing inputs - value is changed "on release" not on input changes, so before you click "Play Subtrack", ensure the changed values are "in".

P.P.S. I know, it would be great to have a visual waveform on a timeline with start and end markers for it to be convenient, but anyway - it simplifies this process a lot and you don't need to explicitly use external programs ;)

## sound-component üîä

It allows you to create a Defold Sound Component out of a compatible sound file (`.wav` or `.ogg`).

1. Right click on a sound file.
2. Select `Create Sound Component`.
3. Eventually change default properties.
5. Click `Create`.

## Installation - FFmpeg dependency

Currently, there is no possibility to do anything with sounds in Editor Scripts, afaik. So I used powerful `execute` and utilised FFmpeg.

In order to use them, you have to install FFmpeg then. Download executables from:

https://www.ffmpeg.org/download.html

And add installation localization to PATH (windows).

On Windows you can also:
1. Open Windows Powershell
2. `winget install ffmpeg`
3. `Y` to confirm
4. Check installation path: `where ffmpeg`
( should give e.g. --> `C:\ffmpeg\bin\ffmpeg.exe`)

On Linux you can (though scripts are Windows only - they need modifications to run on Linux):
1. Open terminal
2. `sudo apt install ffmpeg` (or `sudo snap install ffmpeg`)
3. `Y` to confirm
4. Check installation path: `which -a ffmpeg`
(should give e.g. --> `/usr/bin/ffmpeg` or `/bin/ffmpeg`)

If your path is different, please modify it in scripts (perhaps there should be a script to install ffmpeg and add its path here, but for now.. heh :sweat_smile:) in the common `ffmpeg_helper.lua` module:

    -- Adjust the paths if needed
    local FFMPEG_PATH = "C:/ffmpeg/bin/ffmpeg.exe"
    local FFPLAY_PATH = "C:/ffmpeg/bin/ffplay.exe"
    local FFPROBE_PATH = "C:/ffmpeg/bin/ffprobe.exe"


### FFplay and FFprobe dependency

Additionally, sound-play Editor Script utilizes `ffplay` and sound-cut utilizes `ffprobe`.
Ensure that `ffplay` and `ffprobe` comes with your installation. They might be in `.../ffmpeg/bin/`. 
Check `ffplay -version` and ``ffprobe -version` in terminal. If not, [download them](https://github.com/BtbN/FFmpeg-Builds/releases) and copy there.

## Installation - as Defold dependency 
You can use the these editor scripts in your own project by adding this project as a [Defold library dependency](https://www.defold.com/manuals/libraries/). Open your `game.project` file and in the dependencies field under project add:  
`https://github.com/paweljarosz/editor-scripts-ui-collection/archive/master.zip` or particular version. You can also just copy and paste needed scripts directly to your project directory.
